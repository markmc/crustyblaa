I've been really taken by surprise at how my motivation has jumped  
hugely with the move to Red Hat. I'm even enjoying things like bugzilla  
work, packaging and release-team stuff these days. Clearly, this can't  
last. And I've got to get back hacking on things like Vino soon ...

GNOME 2.6 looks like its pretty much on track. Things like the gtk+  
schedule and the constant string freeze breakage has given the release  
team the heebie jeebies somewhat, but after our irc meeting last night  
I'm feeling pretty confident the release will come out without any huge  
hitches.

Alex and I have been updating the GNOME packages in Fedora Core to the  
latest GNOME Beta ones. Hopefully, by the time FC2 test2 goes into
devel  
freeze on Friday we'll have most of the packages updated. A big
priority  
is to get the new file selector out to the Fedora testing masses, so  
I'm going to update gtk+/atk/pango/glib to the latest today. Also going  
to shove the little gnome-netstatus applet in too :-)
