This [Google Map Pedometer thing](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com) is
pretty damn cool. I mapped out the [17k route](http://tinyurl.com/ar6mc)
I ran tonight. Now I can put aside my deep suspicion of the distances
reported by my own pedometer :-)

If only the satellite imagery for Dublin was a bit better ...
