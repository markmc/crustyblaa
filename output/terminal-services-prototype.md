After a couple of weeks work
[Caolan](http://www.advogato.org/person/caolan)  
and I have gotten together a prototype for a VNC based terminal services
system which  
also supports hotdesking. More details  
[  
here](http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-desktop-list/2004-June/msg00007.html).

This is all part of a bigger plan to use VNC for the four different
"remote desktop"  
uses cases I think we have in GNOME:

-   Terminals (a.k.a. thin clients) which display your desktop running
    on a  
   terminal server
-   Remote administration - allowing sysadmins to remotely help a user
    having  
   difficulties with their desktop
-   Remote access - you're at home and you need to do something on your
    machine  
   in work like save a document you'd forgotten to save or something.
-   Collaboration - a colleague in another office is working on a CAD
    drawing and  
   he wants to demonstrate some of his ideas while talking to you on
    the phone  
   about it

I'll post more of the technical details of how this should all work.
Right now,  
though, I need to go for a few pints and get away from this stuff :-)
