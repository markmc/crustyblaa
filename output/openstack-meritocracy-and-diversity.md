These days, any time I reach for the word "meritocracy" when I want to
explain something about OpenStack's technical community and its
governance, I give pause.

Clearly, [in some circles](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/meritocracy),
the concept of "meritocracy" has been seriously discredited and
represents a system whereby elites perpetuate their power by tilting the
rules in favour of themselves.

I'm not much of a political thinker and my understanding of internal
American politics is pretty limited (think watching The West Wing and
vaguely following the spectacle of a presidential election) so the first
time I really encountered the term was in the context of the GNOME
project. From the [GNOME Foundation
Charter](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/FoundationBoard/Resources/Charter):

> GNOME is a Meritocracy
>
> A corporation, organization or individual should not be granted a
> place in the foundation unless its presence is justified by the merits
> of its contribution. Money cannot buy influence in the GNOME project:
> show us the code (or documentation, or translations, or leadership, or
> webmastering...).

and, subsequently, other projects like the ASF. From [How The ASF
Works](http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#meritocracy):

> When the group felt that the person had "earned" the merit to be part
> of the development community, they granted direct access to the code
> repository, thus increasing the group and increasing the ability of
> the group to develop the program, and to maintain and develop it more
> effectively.
>
> We call this basic principle "meritocracy": literally, government by
> merit.

> What is interesting to note is that the process scaled very well
> without creating friction, because unlike in other situations where
> power is a scarce and conservative resource, in the apache group
> newcomers were seen as volunteers that wanted to help, rather than
> people that wanted to steal a position.
>
> Being no conservative resource at stake (money, energy, time), the
> group was happy to have new people coming in and help, they were only
> filtering the people that they believed committed enough for the task
> and matched the human attitudes required to work well with others,
> especially in disagreement.

To me, the "power" we're talking about here is the ability, permission
or empowerment to get stuff done which advances the project. In some
projects that means commit access, but ultimately it means building up
the respect and trust of the other contributors to the project such that
you can more easily influence and drive the direction of the project.
You achieve that "power" by getting useful stuff done (defined broadly -
code, documentation, translations, leadership, marketing, advocacy,
etc.) and all it grants you is the ability to get more useful stuff
done. In a healthy project, we want to give that power to more and more
people rather than concentrating it in a small elite.

This is what we mean when we say "OpenStack is a technical meritocracy".
I hate to think of those well-meaning principles of project governance
being sullied by "meritocracy" being used to explain away the social
inequities in U.S. politics. I also don't like to think of us seeing
these principles as some sort of platonic ideal that don't require us to
constantly evaluate how we empower people to help advance OpenStack.

One hint that all is not perfect is the level of diversity within the
project. Yes, we have diversity of opinions and a diversity of
sponsoring organizations, but we don't have an impressive level of
gender, race or cultural geography.

My good friend from GNOME days, Daniel Veillard, [asked this question of
the Technical Committee in Hong
Kong](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wslrgu324M&t=1960):

> We are in China. There is no Asian on the podium. What can you do to
> actually try to improve the situation?

Yes, we have a meritocracy and anyone can advance to leadership
positions within the project, but we need to recognize that there are
extremely difficult language and cultural hurdles in front of many.

An example of these barriers is how we often conduct our Design Summit
sessions. Quite regularly - especially when you get a large number of
the more established contributors in the room together, folks who are
good friends who understand each other well - the discussion can often
devolve into a punchy flow of casual in-joke ridden sound-bites. I'm as
much to blame for that as anyone, but sometimes I think back and shudder
at how hard it must be for someone outside of the "in group" to join
that discussion.

I've seen a number of examples where a new non-native English speaker
has paired with an existing contributor to lead a design summit session
about their work. What can work really well is that the existing
contributor can help to engage the attendees, slow down the conversation
and ensure the new contributor understands the feedback being given ...
without attempting to take credit for the work of the new contributor.
This is just one technique we could use to empower new contributors.

Anyway, in summary - I think OpenStack's "meritocracy" is a well-meaning
model for empowering contributors (and celebrating their contributions)
but we should all be on the lookout for ways that we can make a special
effort to empower contributors from groups which are not already well
represented in the leadership of the project.
