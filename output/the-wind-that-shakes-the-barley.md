We went to see [The Wind That Shakes the
Barley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_That_Shakes_the_Barley)
last night. I went along expecting some [Michael
Collins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_%28movie%29) or
[Braveheart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braveheart) romanticised
brit-bashing light entertainment, but no.

This one wasn't easy to watch. It's set during the [Irish War of
Independence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_War_of_Independence)
and [Irish Civil War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Civil_War)
which is only now about to drop out of living memory in Ireland. The
emphasis isn't so much on the fighting, but on the heartbreaking impact
it had on families.

I like this comment on the [IMDb
page](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460989/):
