If [knowledge is
power](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientia_potentia_est), then sharing
your knowledge empowers others.

In the open-source world, each of us endeavours to strengthen the
communities to which we contribute. There is no better way to strengthen
a community than empowering your fellow contributors with your
knowledge.

There are no excuses in the open-source world for not sharing your
knowledge. Our tools and processes are designed to make this happen
naturally.

Having discussions on a mailing list allows other contributors to
benefit from the information being shared in the discussion. It also
ensures that information is archived for future contributors.

Detailed commit messages ensures that current and future developers can
fully understand your reasoning for a given change. Pushing your
in-progress work to a public branch allows others to take the work on
and finish it, even if you don't have time.

Thinking out loud in bugzilla means that even if your work is not
complete on the problem, others can run with your initial ideas or
analysis.

Using a public wiki for note taking and giving others access to your
jumbled up thoughts, ideas, hints and tips is a great way to open your
brain to the world.

A nice side-effect of all this is that if your knowledge is shared
openly and archived, you don't need to have such a good memory! :-)

In other contexts, it might be good practice to jealously guard your
knowledge. If you're the guy that everyone has to come to because you're
the one guy who knows how to do something, that's good for your job
security, right? Surely, if you share your knowledge freely, that means
anyone can do your job?

This is the exact opposite to what should motivate you as you contribute
to a community. You absolutely do want to make it possible for others to
come along and kick your ass. If somebody appears out of nowhere and
starts doing your job better than you could ever have done, then that is
an absolutely awesome outcome!
