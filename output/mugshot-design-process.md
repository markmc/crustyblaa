What I find most interesting about [Mughsot](http://mugshot.org) is the
team's total and no-bullshit commitment to making new and interesting
software which doesn't suck.

I love the way they say their [design
process](http://developer.mugshot.org/wiki/Design_Thinking) *"isn't a
checklist of activites you must do - it's an idea list, suggestions for
how to work smarter"*. I love the way they [prototyped a photos feature
using flickr](http://blog.mugshot.org/?p=73) but were willing to drop it
again after trying it on real people. I love the way they lock
themselves in a room, leaving their laptops behind, and give themselves
the time to hash out ideas properly.

I hope Mugshot itself is a success. But, more than that, I hope they
help change the way the rest of us make software.
