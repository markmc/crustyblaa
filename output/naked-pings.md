Back in November 2009, [ajax](http://people.freedesktop.org/~ajax/) sent
an email on IRC etiquette to Red Hat's company-wide mailing list. I've
had to refer several people to it over the years, so I asked ajax for
permission to publish it. He agreed. Here it is in all its glory.

> IRC has developed a "ping" convention for getting someone's attention.
> It works because most clients will highlight channels in which your
> name has been mentioned, so something like
>
> ajax: ping
>
> will make that channel show up pink instead of white for me \[1\].
>
> I wish to correct, or at least amend, this behaviour. The naked ping
> should be Considered Harmful, for at least two reasons. The first is
> that it conveys no information. The recipient of your ping, like you,
> is a Busy Person. They may be in the middle of something requiring
> intricate thought, and should not be interrupted for anything less
> than fire, flood, or six figures of revenue. Worse, \_you\_ may forget
> why you pinged someone; when, four hours later, your victim gets back
> to IRC and responds to you, \_you\_ will be disrupted in turn trying
> to remember what was on your mind in the first place.
>
> The second, more subtle reason proceeds from the first. A ping with no
> data is essentially a command. It's passive-aggressive; it implies
> that the recipient's time is less valuable than yours. \[2\] The
> pingee will respond in one (or both) of two ways. Either they will
> experience increased stress due to increased unpredictable demands on
> their time, or they will simply ignore naked pings.
>
> The fundamental issue here is a misunderstanding of the medium. IRC is
> not a telephone. It's volatile storage. The whole reason the ping
> works is because the client remembers seeing the ping, and can save it
> in your history buffer so you can see who was talking to you and why.
>
> The naked ping removes this context.
>
> Please. Save your time. Save my time. Make all of our lives more
> efficient and less stressful. Ping with data. At a minimum:
>
> ajax: ping re bz 534027
>
> See the difference? Now you've turned slow, lockstep, PIO-like
> interaction into smooth pipelineable DMA. It's good for your hardware,
> and it's good for you.

> \[1\] - irssi 4 life.

> \[2\] - Their time may well be less valuable than yours. That's not
> the
