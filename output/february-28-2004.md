Its been a fun week completely focused on Fedora packaging and  
bugzilla work. Had a nice wake up call on how huge a time sink  
fixing non x86 builds can be. A day and a half debugging an ABI  
mismatch on pcc breaking the gtk2 build! Sheesh.

Its nice to finish up a week with the feeling that you've got  
a good handle on things, though.
