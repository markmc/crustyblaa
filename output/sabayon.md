I've been been doing a lot of work changing
[Sabayon](http://www.gnome.org/projects/sabayon) around so that the list
of changes you make in the prototype session aren't displayed within the
prototype session itself. I think it makes a lot more sense.

Lots of work still remains to get the changes list someway usable given
the limited space, though. I may have to get
[jrb](http://webwynk.net/jrb/) to rescue me.
