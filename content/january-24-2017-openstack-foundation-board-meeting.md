The [OpenStack Foundation Board of
Directors](https://www.openstack.org/foundation/board-of-directors/)
met for a [two hour conference call on
Tuesday](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation/24Jan2017BoardMeeting). The
usual disclaimer applies - this my informal recollection of the
meeting. Itâ€™s not an official record. Jonathan Bryce has [posted an
official summary of the
meeting](http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/foundation/2017-January/002464.html).

## The 2017 Board

This was the first meeting of the board since the recent [Individual
and Gold member director
elections](http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/foundation/2017-January/002449.html). As
such, Alan asked each of our new directors to introduce themselves:

- Brad Topol
- Brian Stein
- ChangBo Guo
- Christopher Price
- Joseph Wang
- Junwei Liu
- Russell Bryant
- Steven Dake

Alan also thanked our outgoing board members for their contributions:

- Alex Freedland
- Edgar Magana
- Manju Ramanathpura
- Monty Taylor
- Roland Chan
- Raj Patel
- Todd Moore
- Van Lindberg

Since it's a new year, we took the opportunity to review the various
policies which apply to board members:

# [Antitrust policy](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation/AntitrustPolicy)
# [Code of Conduct](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation/CodeOfConduct)
# [Transparency policy](http://www.openstack.org/legal/transparency-policy/)
# Board communication channels, including webex, foundation mailing list, foundation board open and confidential mailing lists, IRC, etherpad, and wiki.

We also took the time to review the list of board committees and
invite board members to volunteer to join these via [the
etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/UnofficialBoardNotes-Jan24-2017).

Finally, we reviewed the board meeting schedule for the year,
including 6 conference calls and 4 in-person meetings.

## Staff Update

Mark Collier then presented an update to the board. Reflecting on our
strategy, he talked about three forces that need to be in alignment -
the ecosystem, the software, and our users. The [slide
deck](http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/foundation/attachments/20170125/86672a90/attachment-0001.pdf)
gives a good view into the discussion.

## Commitee Actions and Updates

Next up, the compensation gave a brief summary of their review of
Jonathan's performance in 2016, which had been shared in advance with
the board.

The Interop Working Group also talked through [their January 2017
report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MFotmauuwZXmmhiTj_iyzUIOcTZA1V8JXgPk8Lqdc-4)
and the board voted to approve the [2017.01
guideline](https://github.com/openstack/defcore/blob/master/doc/source/guidelines/2017.01.rst).

## Strategic Discussions

Finally, the board spent some time discussing the strategic planning
discussions that started at [the November
meeting](https://crustyblaa.com/november-17-openstack-foundation-board-meeting.html)
and continued during [the December
meeting](https://crustyblaa.com/december-6-openstack-foundation-board-meeting.html). Our
hope is to have a joint meeting with the Technical Committee in March
to spend significant time on the topic. Allison Randal discussed
various options to prepare for the meeting, including conducting
one-to-one interviews or a public survey.
