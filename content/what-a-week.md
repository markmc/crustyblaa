Wow, what a week. [GUADEC](http://2005.guadec.org) was excellent. Lots
of interesting talks and a great buzz from everyone. I was sorry to have
to leave a day early, especially since I missed [Glynn's
talk](http://www.gnome.org/~gman/blog//02062005-1) which looked like a
lot of fun. I've dumped the slides from my talk
[here](http://www.gnome.org/~markmc/guadec-2005-remotely-useful).

The [Red Hat Summit](http://www.redhat.com/promo/summit/) blew me away
too. The whole thing was incredibly well organised and exciting to be a
part of. I especially enjoyed just talking to random Red Hat customers
and users etc.

The summit ended at lunchtime today, but even in that short time we had
yet another cool video, inspirational talks from Bruce Mau (about the
[Massive Change](http://www.massivechange.com) project ... what an
interesting way to look at the modern world), Dr. Deepak Phatak (who has
been [  
bringing Open Source to education in
India](http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=47900215&tid=5979))
and [Sanjiva Weerawarana](http://www.bloglines.com/blog/sanjiva) (who is
heavily involved in the [Sahana](http://sahana.sourceforge.net) project
which was created to solve some of the logistical problems with the
Tsunami relief effort). And most importantly, the creation of the Fedora
Foundation was announced.

I'm truly shattered now, though.
