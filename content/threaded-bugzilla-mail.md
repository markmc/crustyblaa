Woo! As, [Jeremy](http://www.livejournal.com/users/katzj/) points  
out, dkl has [enabled  
threading](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=125335)
in Red Hat's bugzilla mail. Now I can stop filtering my mail  
through "fixup-threading.sh" :-)

Red Hat developers are soon going to wonder how they ever survived
without  
this. We GNOME hackers have been spoilt for far too long ...
