A nice little pile of books arrived from Amazon yesterday for  
my birthday. Being a slow reader, that should keep me going  
for a good few months :-)

The one I've started with, "Unlocking the Sky: Glen Hammond  
Curtiss and the Race to Invent the Airplane", was Tiemann's  
recommendation on [Red  
Hat's summer reading list](http://www.redhat.com/mktg/summer_read). It
seems to be a really good read  
which appears at first glance to be totally unrelated, but actually  
very relevant, to what we're all doing here.
