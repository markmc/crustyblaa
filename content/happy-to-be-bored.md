So, I've got working patches now for TLS/SSL support in the  
[  
C++](http://www.gnome.org/~markmc/code/vnc-4.0b5-vncviewer-tls.diff)
and  
[  
Java](http://www.gnome.org/~markmc/code/vnc-4.0b5-java-tls.diff) VNC
clients. That was all pretty boring since I'd already  
(months ago) written a bunch of test code with  
[GNU TLS](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls) and the  
[Java Secure Socket Extension](http://java.sun.com/products/jsse).

I'm sure there's a moral to that, but I can't quite put my finger on  
it ...
