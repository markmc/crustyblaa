The [results of the OpenStack Technical
Committee](http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-announce/2013-October/000152.html)
have just been announced. I'm very grateful to everyone who voted for
me. Thanks!

This is going to be a very different committee than previously. For the
first time, PTLs of integrated projects do not have an automatic seat. I
think this will be a positive change and see TC members generally take
more of an interest in cross-project issues. That said, we need to be
careful to explicitly include PTLs in decision making which affect their
projects.

One thing I'm curious about is how this new TC makeup will affect
discussions about the increase in OpenStack's technical scope. I went
through each of candidate's nomination emails and pulled out some quotes
below. To me, this represents a high level of consensus towards a
continued cautious and measured growth in the project's scope ... but
make your own mind up! I'm actually quite surprised how many candidates
felt it was important to give their views on this.
