I've posted description to the [Fedora
wiki](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/) about how we're implementing the
[cached
client](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/StatelessLinuxCachedClient) part
of Stateless Linux in FC6.

Pile onto the
[stateless-list](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/stateless-list)
if you want to yak about it.
