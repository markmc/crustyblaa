I knew of [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org)'s existence, and  
I knew what it was, but I'd never really spent any amount of time
looking at  
it. [Seth](http://www.gnome.org/~seth/) was babbling happily about  
it at one point while I was in Westford so I went and took a good look.
What  
really strikes you is not only the sheer size of the thing, but the
quality  
of the content. Very impressive.

Anyway, I added my own drop to the fountain of knowledge - an entry on
the  
famous Waterford [Blaa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaa).
