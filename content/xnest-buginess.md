Anyone that uses Xnest will have gotten annoyed when it gets confused
about the modifier state and it thinks e.g. Alt is pressed when its
clearly not. Given that the bug has been around forever, it was
seriously gratifying to [fix
it](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3030) last week.

And before anyone says "Xnest sucks; use
[Xephr](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Xephyr)", this is
actually a bug in Xephr too ... :-)
