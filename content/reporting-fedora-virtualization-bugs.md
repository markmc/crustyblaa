When reporting bugs against Fedora, the
[BugsAndFeatureRequests](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugsAndFeatureRequests)
wiki page is a great place to get some information on the kind of things
you can do to provide useful information in the bug report.

I've just added a page on [reporting virtualization
bugs](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Tools/Virtualization/BugReporting).
Hopefully it'll help people find narrow down bugs, log files, get debug
spew etc.

And, of course, it's a wiki page - so go ahead and add your own tips!
