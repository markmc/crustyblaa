I'd read some of [Joel's](http://www.joelonsoftware.com) articles  
before, not never really got around to reading a lot of them. Maybe its  
because I hate reading long articles on a computer; maybe its because I  
only became aware of his stuff well after he was at his most prolific.

Anyway, I'm thoroughly enjoying reading [the  
book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590593898/ref=nosim/joelonsoftware)
at the moment. Catherine gave me her typical "you're such a freak" look  
last night as I chuckled to myself over this description of
[Architecture  
Astronauts](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html):

> When you go too far up, abstraction-wise, you run out of oxygen.
> Sometimes smart thinkers just don't know when to stop, and they create
> these absurd, all-encompassing, high-level pictures of the universe
> that are all good and fine, but don't actually mean anything at all.
