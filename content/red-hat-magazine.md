I'm always a tad shocked when [Red Hat
Magazine](http://www.redhat.com/magazine/) comes out every month with
some genuinely interesting and useful articles. Really nice to see
[Integrating your applications into the desktop, Part
1](http://www.redhat.com/magazine/012oct05/features/freedesktop/) from
[Zana](http://zana.webwynk.net/) this month, for example.
