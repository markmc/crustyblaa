A rather "interesting" day doing bugzilla work, disting and  
pushing 2.5.4 tarballs and jhbuilding GNOME HEAD in parallel  
over a 56k dialup line. I think I'll be counting down the  
minutes until the [Eircom](http://www.eircom.ie)  
fools manage to flick the magic DSL switch ...

How on earth did I put up with this for an entire year in  
New Zealand?
