Thanks to [Olav](http://blogs.gnome.org/ovitters/), I can post here
again after nearly 10 months (!). Not that I had anything to say anyway
:-P

But for the past couple of months I've been writing about stuff like
hiking, running and sailing on [another
blog](http://bovineboy.wordpress.com) and today's tidbit is that I
[finished my first
marathon](http://bovineboy.wordpress.com/2007/10/30/dublin-marathon-2007/)
yesterday.
