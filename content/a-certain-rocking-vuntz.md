So, I just plowed through a few hundred emails in my gnome-panel
[bugzilla.gnome.org](http://bugzilla.gnome.org) folder. In one  
sense it was incredibly boring, because I don't think I actually  
interacted with a single bug report, but in another sense its was just  
incredibly awesome. The folder appears to be just full of bugs which  
[Vincent Untz](http://www.vuntz.net) has already  
closed. Rocking!

I didn't know Vincent had a [blog](http://www.vuntz.net/blog/),
interesting. I'll need to  
polish my French a bit to understand it, though. About all I could  
understand was `"J'adore vim"`. I guess its a good thing he  
uses vim, really. If he used emacs he'd put us all to even more  
shame fixing even more bugs.
