I've been around open source mailing lists for so long now that I tend
to forget that our conventions around sending plain text emails, quoting
replies, threading, etc. aren't necessarily obvious to everyone out
there.

That's especially true for some of the folks working on RHEV-M, many of
whom have come from a Windows development background. I eventually
realized that saying "just do what everyone else does" wasn't really
good enough and spent some time documenting what all those little
conventions are.

I've posted [some
guidelines](https://fedorahosted.org/rhevm-api/wiki/Email_Guidelines) to
the rhevm-api wiki. What am I missing?
