He Calls Himself an Irishman?

So, [Glynn](http://www.gnome.org/~gman/blog)'s a posh  
D4 Dubliner. Don't mind him. Most of us Waterford knackers with  
a bit of national pride think [Ireland's  
Call](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland%27s_Call) is an abomination
and that Ireland is losing some of  
its national identity by not using [Amhrán na  
bhFiann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amhr%E1n_na_bhFiann) for rugby.

It has one great side effect, though. Everyone can now actually  
understand what they're singing! You won't find many irishmen  
who are fluent enough in their national language enough to be  
able to translate this:

         Sinne Fianna Fáil
         A tá fé gheall ag Éirinn,
         buion dár slua
         Thar toinn do ráinig chugainn,
         Fé mhóid bheith saor.
         Sean tír ár sinsir feasta
         Ní fhagfar fé'n tiorán ná fé'n tráil
         Anocht a théam sa bhearna bhaoil,
         Le gean ar Ghaeil chun báis nó saoil
         Le guna screach fé lámhach na bpiléar
         Seo libh canaídh Amhrán na bhFiann.

Watch closely next time you see an Irish sports team during  
their national anthem. Count with your fingers how many of  
the players are actually singing rather than humming, swaying  
from side to side and generally looking embarrassed. You  
won't need your other hand ...
