I've seen all sorts of humor, tips, and ideas from folks as we all
learn to cope with these strange times, but somehow I don't feel like
I've had a lot of insight into the practicalities of family life for
folks in a similar situation to us. So, five days into our new
situation, I thought I'd share.

Who are we? We're a family of two adults with full-time jobs, two
young girls (9yo and 4yo), and a recent addition of a 4 month old
Miniature Schnauzer. We live in Dublin, in the coastal village of
Raheny.

Usually, our kids are looked after Monday-Friday between 8.30am and
6.30pm each day (school, creche, childminder at home) and we have some
outside help with housework. Starting Friday, March 13, we're learning
to cope without any of that help, while continuing to work our two
busy and responsible jobs from home.

So, last Thursday evening, we found ourselves in front of a whiteboard
trying to come up with a plan. Our basic idea was:

* We needed a predictable daily routine to keep everyone sane
* We'd experiment with keeping that routine 7 days per week, and not
  adjust much at weekends - this was to avoid putting ourselves on too
  much daily work pressure by keeping to a 5 day work week
* Each of us would get a uninterrupted chunk of 4-5 hours work time
  every day, either in the morning or afternoon
* We'd start every day with one of us leaving the house by 9.30am with
  the kids and dog, to visit any one of the local parks and beaches
  around
* Early to bed, early to rise - no compromising on sleep!
* We'd carve out time alone for focused home workouts

The key question each evening for the next day is which of is working
in the morning, and which of us is working in the afternoon. With that
decided, we know the routine.

Morning worker:

* 6am - Up, coffee, get to work
* 8am - Join the family for breakfast, then back to work
* 12pm - Join the family for lunch, and take over parenting
* 1pm - School time
* 3pm - Arts and crafts
* 5.30pm - Serve dinner for the family
* 6pm - Take the dog for a walk
* 6.30pm - Family screen time, catch up on some email, get kids to bed
* 9pm - Evening news, chillax
* 10pm - Bed!

Afternoon worker:

* 6am - Up, coffee, deal with some email
* 7.30am - Kids get up, prep breakfast for 8am
* 9.30am - Head to the park/beach with kids and dog
* 11.30am - Arrive home, prepare lunch for 12pm
* 12.30pm - Start work
* 5.30pm - Join the family for dinner
* 6.30pm - Family screen time, catch up	on some	email, get kids	to bed
* 9pm - Evening news, chillax
* 10pm - Bed!

This has been working reasonably well, with some caveats:

* The "uninterrupted" chunk of work time is your main opportunity to
  do anything that would be difficult to do with the kids -
  e.g. workouts, grocery shopping, etc.
* We're not robots, so the schedule does flex - e.g. the snooze button
  is as tempting as ever, and I'm probably playing too much Minecraft
  with my eldest!
* It can be hard to organize all work meetings in your chunk of work
  time, so we do adjust a bit for super important meetings that don't
  fit
* It's only day five!
