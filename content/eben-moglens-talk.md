[What Chris said](http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/weblog/?p=209). Go watch
Eben's talk, it really is worth it. I'm going to watch it again.

Chris had a nice quote, but you can skip randomly to any part and get
other equally nice quotes.

"The patent has become a real estate entitlement, not based upon the
social value it produces, but rather irrespective of the social *harm*
it may induce."
