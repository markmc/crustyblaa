[QEMU](http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/) has a number of really nice
ways to set up networking for its guests. It can be a little bewildering
to figure out how each of the options work, so I thought I'd [write up
what I found](http://www.gnome.org/~markmc/qemu-networking.html). Excuse
the 'orrid ascii art :-)
