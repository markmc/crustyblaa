[Dan](http://berrange.com) I have been discussing how to "fix virtual
networking", not just Xen's networking but also getting something sane
wrt. QEMU/KVM etc.

Anyone interested should read [this
writeup](http://www.gnome.org/~markmc/virtual-networking.html). To
discuss,
[libvirt-list](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libvir-list) is
probably the best place.
