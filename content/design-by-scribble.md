Yesterday, I finally got around to hacking up a dialog in Sabayon where
you can assign profiles to users. Code-wise, I knew it was pretty
trivial, but for once I decided to spend some time thinking about the UI
design rather than hoping a real designer would come along and rescue me
later.

So, I scribbled down a [rough
design](http://www.gnome.org/~markmc/sabayon-user-assignment-ui.html),
humed and hawed for a while and got hacking. I'm not totally depressed
with the end result, so that's something ...
