This Red Hat company meeting thing was a weird experience for  
me. Realizing just how deeply rooted open source is in the Red Hat  
culture. Realizing that what I'm hearing isn't just the lip service to  
open source that I heard in Sun. Seeing a real understanding of and  
commitment to open source from each of the 600ish people  
attending. Its like coming home or something. Man, I'm so psyched  
after the whole thing.

Well, I'm pretty exhausted too :-)
