[This](http://nat.org/2004/september/#9-September-2004) bothers me and  
I'm not sure why.

Is it the irony in judging someone by the book they're reading, and then
claiming  
to not pick your books by the point you're making to the world?

Perhaps its the implication that judging someone by the book they're
reading is  
somehow more intelligent than judging them by the shoes they're wearing?

Or maybe its because I'm reading a lame, trashy, populist book at the
moment.

Ah no, I've just figured out why it bothers me ... its that the very
fact that  
I'm writing this proves that I've managed to completely mislay my sense
of  
humour somewhere ... Wonder where I put it?
