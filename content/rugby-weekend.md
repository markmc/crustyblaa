Another big [Six  
Nations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Nations_Championship) rugby
weekend over that saw Scotland beat Italy in the  
dullest international game in a while, Wales beating France in a  
breathtaking match in Paris and Ireland beating world champions  
England in a tense, down-to-the-wire encounter in Dublin.

Its all looking like it'll end with a grand slam showdown between  
Ireland and Wales in Cardiff. Who would have thought it?

The most bizarre example of how professionalism has changed Irish  
rugby is that Brian O'Driscoll, Ireland's star centre, having strained  
his hamstring was sent to [this whole body  
cryotherapy unit](http://www.cosspala.com.pl/krio/ecenter.htm) where you
get put in a freezer at below -120°C  
(-184°F) for a few minutes so that you can train at four times the  
inensity for the next few hours. Three weeks after an injury that  
would have put players out for months and he's back on the pitch  
leading the team and scoring tries.
