So, today is my last day working for Sun which feels very, very  
strange. Its been a great few years and I'm genuinely going to  
miss this place and the great people here. I still can't believe  
that my dream of working full time on free software has come  
true. Sun made that possible - for that I'll be ever grateful.

On the upside, though, it marks the start of a new and exciting  
adventure - working for Red Hat. Its a little daunting, actually.  
Having seen the awesome work the guys do, I've no idea if I'll  
be able to live up to their standards. I can't wait to get  
started though :-)

I hope people don't read into this something that isn't there -  
even though I'm leaving, I still think Sun is a great place to  
work and that its a company with a seriously bright future.  
My moving to Red Hat has nothing to do with which is a "better"  
company, and everything to do with me wanting to take up the  
opportunity of a new challenge.

I can't get Robert Frost's  
[*The Road  
Not Taken*](http://www.poets.org/poems/poems.cfm?prmID=1645) out of my
head right now. It pretty well sums  
up how I'm feeling ... but that could just be the hangover :-)
