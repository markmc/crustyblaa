-   Up early; chewed mail;
-   Amazing lack of listening on the xdg list from Michael along the
    lines  
   of: "let me fix my problems right now with the least amount of pain
    to  
   me. I don't mind if its a big hack which everyone else will copy".
    The  
   encouraging thing from this is I suppose that in the past I would
    have  
   taken this (IMHO fairly nonsensical/incomprehensible stalling
    position)  
   as cast-iron proof of Michael just not listening; however, one can
    only  
   conclude from this discussion that there is some sort of unhelpful,  
   underlying ignoring the  
   [point](http://freedesktop.org/pipermail/xdg/2004-May/004040.html)  
   going on ... nice to have this insight.

:-P
