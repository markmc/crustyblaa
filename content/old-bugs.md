[commented](http://tieguy.org/blog/index.cgi/181.html) on old  
bugs recently. It certainly feels good to close old bugs. Like this
[four year old  
bug](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19197).

People will be glad to know that with very latest glibc (it'll be in  
glibc 2.3.4), you'll be able to change the timezone and the clock  
applet will actually notice. Yay for us! :-)
