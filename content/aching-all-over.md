Spent the weekend surfing with five friends on the wild and windy west  
coast. Having never surfed before, I'm now so sore I can barely  
move. If I had to leave the house to do my job, I'd be taking the day  
off I reckon.

Six of the lads going away for the weekend used to be a Very Dangerous  
Thing. But this weekend we managed to stay out of trouble. Are we  
getting old or were we just too tired after the surfing? I wonder ...

Never in my life have I never heard so many bad chat-up lines, though:

> Boy standing in pub porch smoking. Girl runs in out of the rain and  
> stops. Boy, "How's it going?". Girl looks up, sees the inane drunken  
> grin, dismisses Boy immediately, looks back down at her phone and  
> starts typing a text message. Boy, "Ah, we've only just met and
> you're  
> texting me already?". Girl runs.
